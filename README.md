## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the research project report on Student performance Indicator. It is very important for
any means of improving educational outcomes. The present study explores the potential of a
wide range of machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, K-Nearest
Neighbors Regressor, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor,
CatBoosting Regressor, and AdaBoost Regressor in determining student performance
indicators. Through comparison of how these models perform in the prediction of student
performance, we identify the best way to identify the superior approach for institutions in
educational practice that are to use machine learning for data-driven decision-making and
personalized learning strategies
